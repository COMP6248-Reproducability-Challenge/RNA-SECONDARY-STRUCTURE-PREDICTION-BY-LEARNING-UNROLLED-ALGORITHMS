ICLR Submission: https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1eALyrYDH

This paper proposed a model called 'E2Efold' which is an end-to-end deep learning model. The key idea of E2Efold is to directly predict the RNA base-pairing matrix, and use an unrolled algorithm for constrained programming as the template for deep architectures to enforce constraints.
